# Notes on wave-particle duality

[These notes](https://github.com/jsdiazpo/JK0-Notes-24-Wave-Particle/blob/main/JK_Notes_24_Wave_Particle.pdf) are intended as supporting material for the video [This is how the wave-particle duality of light was discovered](https://youtu.be/f7JvywBOGYY) on my YouTube channel. 

These notes will be updated in case that any correction is needed. I will also likely include extra material soon. If you spot any typo or error in the calculation just use the [comments section of the video](https://youtu.be/f7JvywBOGYY) and report the problem, I will happily fix it here.
